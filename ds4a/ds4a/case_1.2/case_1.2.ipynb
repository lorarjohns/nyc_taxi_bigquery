    "What are some insights you can draw from the ```VolStat``` summary statistics in terms of volatility levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer.** Symbol EXC seems to have higher volatility that the other stocks. Perhaps symbol EXC has a different business model or has had a turbulent business environment in recent years. Further analysis is needed to determine the actual cause of the higher volatility relative to the other energy sector stocks."

    "Before we plot, we need to convert the the ```Date``` column in ```agg_df``` to a ```datetime```-like object, Python's internal data representation of dates. ```pandas``` offers the ```to_datetime()``` method to convert a String that represents a given date format into a ```datetime```-like object. We instruct ```pandas``` to use ```format='%Y-%m-%d'```, since our dates are in this format, where %Y indicates the numerical year, %m indicates the numerical month and %d indicates the numerical day. If our dates were in another format, we'd modify this input value appropriately."

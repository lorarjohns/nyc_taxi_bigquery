While you are editing the files in the staging area, you can of course save these files as you progress, however the files on your working directory will not have changed since you need to commit the changes. Hence, you essentially have two versions of files, one that you are editing, and one that is a snapshot from the previous commit.\n",

    "Python is an interpreted, high-level general programming language that was first released in 1991. Python allows users to easily manipulate data and store values in what are known as <b>objects</b>. Everything in Python is an object and has a <b>type</b>. For example, if a user aims to store the integer 5 in an object named ```my_int```, this can be accomplished by the statement, ```my_int = 5```. This statement tells Python to assign the integer value of 5 to the **variable** ```my_int``` (called a variable here because it can change value). ```my_int``` is a Python object, and has type ```int```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to how Excel distinguishes different data types (such as Text, Number, Currency, Scientific), Python offers a variety of data types. Here are a few common data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Integers, type ```int```: ```my_int = 1```\n",
    "2. Float type ```float```: ```my_float = 25.5```\n",
    "3. Strings, type ```str```: ```my_string = 'Hello'```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see (1) <b>integers</b> and (2) <b>floats</b> store numeric data.  The difference between the two is that floats store decimal variables, whereas the integer type can only store integer variables. (3) is the <b>string</b> type. Strings are used to store textual data in Python. This case will use string variables to store country names. They are often used to store identifiers such as person names, city names, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other data types available in Python; however, these are the three fundamental types that you will see across almost every Python program. Always keep in mind that **every** object in Python has a type.\n",

In ```success_estimates``` below, the list contains float types. Lists are versatile and can be expanded by adding new elements to the end of the list (the right-most side is considered the end of the list).

There is no mapping between keys and values in Python lists, rather list elements are accessed using integer indices. Lists are commonly used to group related data together for further processing. In this case, the regional level data would still consist of key-value pairs (where the keys are the region names), so lists are not ideal.\n",

    "(d) Revisit why some countries only have one estimate and see if more data can be sourced for these countries\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer.** (d).\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer (a) sounds like a good approach, however it will not accomplish the task at hand. The task is to find a specific country for global expansion, not a region. Thus, if one were to regroup countries to regions, they would first have to redefine the problem statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer (b) is an incorrect method to handle this particular data set since country statistics should be calculated independently of other countries. If one countries estimates depend on another, this could significantly complicate the analysis and would likely require a more complex and costly investigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding answer (c), using a different summary statistic will not solve the problem of having one sample for the statistical calculation. We would like to have more confidence in our statistical estimate. Using a different measure of success such as the minimum or maximum estimate will not ameliorate the single-sample size issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to revisit the source of the data set for a problem as an iterative analysis is performed. Hence, answer (d) is a correct approach to ameliorate the one-sample size problem.  As new insight is gained throughout the analysis, one should always reflect on the data collection process and determine if any new information may help the analysis to move forward. In this case, upon observing some countries having one estimate, it would likely be beneificial to determine why some countries have such small numbers of estimates and if there is a simple, cost-effective method to obtain additional estimates for these countries before moving forward in the analysis.\n"

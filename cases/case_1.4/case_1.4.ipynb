    "**Answer.** (a). We have a couple options that are generally acceptable on how to proceed with missing values:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. One option is to replace the missing values by re-gathering the data. However, this option is often quite expensive in real man-hours, so we will forgo it for now.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. In practice, a regularly chosen option when only a small amount of data is missing is to just remove the rows that have missing data. This option is generally fine to perform so long as the removed data is an insignificant portion of the data under study. Here we will choose this option as it simplifies the analysis and should not harm any results moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer (a) is problematic because replacing a missing value with the previous day's value doesn't make sense for stocks because stock prices and trading volumes are known to move day-to-day rather than remain unchanged for an extended period of time. Since we will be dealing with daily returns and volatility, this is especially problematic as it defaults any missing day's volatility and return to 0.\n",

We found that for the stocks under study, there is no strong link between volatility level and the direction of the daily stock return. Moreover, we found that when comparing stocks to the broader market, their returns and volatility levels are amplified when the market returns and volatility levels are high. These findings indicate there is an intrinsic link between returns and volatility, both in the single stock case and the broader market case. This lends a variety of avenues of exploration for follow-up projects."
